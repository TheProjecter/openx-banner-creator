= Campaign-wide banner update =

== The problem ==
In certain cases it is just too difficult to update banners with some common information.
For example, you have 25 banners of different types and sizes running across different sites. You change specials on a daily basis. Changing all banners daily is a drain on time and resources.

== A solution ==
Banners created by ZetaPrints image generator using templates can also be updated using the same templates and ZetaPrints image generator.

Assume that a catalog has 10 banner. They have some text fields in common. One of them is "Special info". Today's special is "Free shipping". Selected banners for a campaign get updated with their existing texts and images + the new text for "Special info" in one step. Newly generated banner images are automatically uploaded into OpenX and become available immediately.

== Features ==

Work in progress. See list of Issues for details: http://code.google.com/p/openx-banner-creator/issues/list
